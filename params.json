Me included.\r\n\r\nSo here is a little routine that can BANISH that messy page from hell and replace it with something you like.\r\n\r\nFirstly create a directory newtab (or sumptin)\r\n\r\nInside it you are going to create a file called\r\n\r\nmanifest.json - in it\r\n````\r\n{ \r\n\t\"manifest_version\": 2, \r\n\t\"name\": \"StupidBoxes\", \r\n\t\"version\": \"1.0\", \r\n\t\"description\": \"Improving GOOGLE\", \r\n\t\"chrome_url_overrides\" : { \r\n\t\t\"newtab\": \"newtab.html\" \r\n\t} \r\n}\r\n````\r\nThat's mine, you get the idea.\r\n\r\nthen create your own newtab.html. Here is mine\r\n````1\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n\t<head>\r\n\t\t<title>Addinall's Override TAB Page</title>\r\n\r\n\t\t<style>\r\n\t\tbody {\r\n\t\t\tbackground-image: url('images/cerebus-newtab.jpg');\r\n\t\t\tbackground-repeat: no-repeat;\r\n\t\t\tbackground-position: center;\r\n\t\t\tbackground-size: cover;\r\n\t\t\twidth: 100%;\r\n\t\t\theight: 100%;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t</style>\r\n\t</head>\r\n\r\n\t<body>\r\n\t</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n````\r\n\r\nYou can stick whatever you fancy in your newtab page now. The omnibar up the top still does a Google search.\r\n\r\nThen go to Extensions. Load unpacked extensions in Developer mode, and you are up and away!\r\n\r\n## Mark Addinall\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
